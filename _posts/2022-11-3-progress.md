## Preface

In this project, we wanted to make a rather useful program that could be used daily: a
dictionary. To make this possible, however, we had to find out how to create such an object. To
make a dictionary, we scoured the internet for instructive videos which labeled the skeleton of
an online dictionary through class lessons, we learned that the easiest way to create such a
device would be to use an API. Through RapidAPI, an API website, we quickly discovered a
suitable API for our project. We then utilized our resources carefully, planning 2-week sprints in
order to complete the project. We also used Scrum boards to plan what to do and when to do it.
One of the teamâ€™s earliest problems was a communication issue. How were they to reach each
other and communicate with them? In this issue, Slack was their saving grace: it helped the
team communicate when at home and plan meetings to catch up.

## Issues in Making the Project

Another issue that the team encountered was finding good resources to help with the
design of the dictionary and troubleshooting it. Not many people had before designed an entire
dictionary using API and Visual Studio Code. To help us, our APCSP course helped us by not
only introducing us to API in the first place but also teaching us the fine art of troubleshooting
and debugging. Our course helped us a lot on this project and helped us understand the
ever-complicated world of computer science.

## Scrum Master Statement

The team has definitely worked hard to reach the completion of the project and has truly
understood the workings of computer science and several other objects that they required to
complete the task of creating a dictionary. The team faced several issues and hiccups in the
procedure but did not give up, whatever stood in their way.
