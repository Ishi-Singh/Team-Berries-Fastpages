## Planning

- This is an overview of our plans going into the project. Since we're still in some of the beginning stages of making this project we don't know if all of these ideas will be implemented in the final product. but we hope to implement as many of them if time permits.

## DevOps Engineer

Goals:

- figure out why we keep having merge conflicts
- help the backend developer connect the backend code to the frontend  
- use html forms to collect input in the form of search bars:

## Backend Developer

- Made a feedback page using the Jokes API

We wanted our project to be more interactive so we decided to makes a feedback page with help from the Jokes API. A quick overview on the backend code, we have a list which contains our feedback questions the feedback data contains dictionaries with key value pairs as shown in feedback data.append. This is also shown on the Team Berries Fastpage and on the flask portfoilo.

'''
import random

feedback_data = []
feedback_list = [
    "Was this website efficient?",
    "Is the site aesthetically pleasing?",
    "Were you able to find your word?",
    "Are we better than our competitors?",
    "If this project were to be available on the market, would you use it?"
    
]

# Initialize jokes
def initFeedback():
    # setup jokes into a dictionary with id, joke, haha, boohoo
    item_id = 0
    for item in feedback_list:
        feedback_data.append({"id": item_id, "feedback": item, "yes": 0, "no": 0})
        item_id += 1
    # prime some haha responses
    for i in range(10):
        id = getRandomFeedback()['id']
        addFeedbackHaHa(id)
    # prime some haha responses
    for i in range(5):
        id = getRandomFeedback()['id']
        addFeedbackBooHoo(id)
        
# Return all jokes from jokes_data
def getFeedbacks():
    return(feedback_data)

# Joke getter
def getFeedback(id):
    return(feedback_data[id])

# Return random joke from jokes_data
def getRandomFeedback():
    return(random.choice(feedback_data))

# Liked joke
def favoriteFeedback():
    best = 0
    bestID = -1
    for feedback in getFeedbacks():
        if feedback['yes'] > best:
            best = feedback['yes']
            bestID = feedback['id']
    return feedback_data[bestID]
    
# Jeered joke
def jeeredFeedback():
    worst = 0
    worstID = -1
    for feedback in getFeedbacks():
        if feedback['no'] > worst:
            worst = feedback['no']
            worstID = feedback['id']
    return feedback_data[worstID]

# Add to haha for requested id
def addFeedbackHaHa(id):
    feedback_data[id]['yes'] = feedback_data[id]['yes'] + 1
    return feedback_data[id]['yes']

# Add to boohoo for requested id
def addFeedbackBooHoo(id):
    feedback_data[id]['no'] = feedback_data[id]['no'] + 1
    return feedback_data[id]['no']

# Pretty Print joke
def printFeedback(joke):
    print(joke['id'], joke['feedback'], "\n", "yes:", joke['yes'], "\n", "no:", joke['no'], "\n")

# Number of jokes
def countFeedback():
    return len(feedback_data)

# Test Joke Model
if __name__ == "__main__": 
    initFeedback()  # initialize jokes
    
    # Most likes and most jeered
    best = favoriteFeedback()
    print("Most liked", best['yes'])
    printFeedback(best)
    worst = jeeredFeedback()
    print("Most jeered", worst['no'])
    printFeedback(worst)
    
    # Random joke
    print("Random joke")
    printFeedback(getRandomFeedback())
    
    # Count of Jokes
    print("Jokes Count: " + str(countFeedback()))

- Wireframes for our website

This is how we want to make the inital user input screen

This is what the user should see after inputing a word

We also want to add a word of the day page which gives a list of some words

- Considerations made for customers
We understand the customer needs an efficiant website which is user friendly, so were going to make our website easy to use and provide instructions as well to help them make the most out of their experience. We'll also try to make an efficiant website by removing non-essential items which slow the efficiancy of our website, allowing for a better customer expirience

- Accommodations
We plan to add text-to-speech to our project to help people with vision problems and for those who are learning English we'll add a translator, allowing for people to translate any word to their languages for convinience. Through this we can reach a wider variety of people, allowing us to help more people.
