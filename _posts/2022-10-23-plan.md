- This is an overview of our plans going into the project. Since we're still in some of the beginning stages of making this project we don't know if all of these ideas will be implemented in the final product. but we hope to implement as many of them if time permits.

We also want to add a word of the day page which gives a list of some words

- Considerations made for customers
We understand the customer needs an efficiant website which is user friendly, so were going to make our website easy to use and provide instructions as well to help them make the most out of their experience. We'll also try to make an efficiant website by removing non-essential items which slow the efficiancy of our website, allowing for a better customer expirience

- Accommodations
We plan to add text-to-speech to our project to help people with vision problems and for those who are learning English we'll add a translator, allowing for people to translate any word to their languages for convinience. Through this we can reach a wider variety of people, allowing us to help more people.
