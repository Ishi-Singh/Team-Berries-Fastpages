            "content": "Preface . In this project, we wanted to make a rather useful program that could be used daily: a dictionary. To make this possible, however, we had to find out how to create such an object. To make a dictionary, we scoured the internet for instructive videos which labeled the skeleton of an online dictionary through class lessons, we learned that the easiest way to create such a device would be to use an API. Through RapidAPI, an API website, we quickly discovered a suitable API for our project. We then utilized our resources carefully, planning 2-week sprints in order to complete the project. We also used Scrum boards to plan what to do and when to do it. One of the team’s earliest problems was a communication issue. How were they to reach each other and communicate with them? In this issue, Slack was their saving grace: it helped the team communicate when at home and plan meetings to catch up. . Issues in Making the Project . Another issue that the team encountered was finding good resources to help with the design of the dictionary and troubleshooting it. Not many people had before designed an entire dictionary using API and Visual Studio Code. To help us, our APCSP course helped us by not only introducing us to API in the first place but also teaching us the fine art of troubleshooting and debugging. Our course helped us a lot on this project and helped us understand the ever-complicated world of computer science. . Scrum Master Statement . The team has definitely worked hard to reach the completion of the project and has truly understood the workings of computer science and several other objects that they required to complete the task of creating a dictionary. The team faced several issues and hiccups in the procedure but did not give up, whatever stood in their way. .",

            "content": "Week 1 . During Week 1 our main goal was to find resources that could help us make a reverse dictionary. We knew how to use an API to make a dictionary which could take user inputs and give a definition based on that input, but we didn’t know how to reverse that. Each group member made a personal plan on what each of us will bring to the project and what we hope to personally accomplish. This included general goals such as making a scrum board to track and solve issues and goals which were more specific to our project like making a feedback page. To read more about our plans from Week 1 click here. . Week 2 . During this week we found out that reversing our dictionary would be more difficult and time consuming than we originally anticipated so we decided to change our project to a regular dictionary. This change would allow us to make more progress on the development of website because we don’t need to spend much of our precious time trying to complete a project that wouldn’t be done by the deadline. During this week we made a feedback page on our blogsite so people can leave reviews, promoting customer interaction with the team. An “About Us” page was also created where cards were used to show everyone’s job and link their personal blog. . Week 3 . Week 3 was mostly finalizing changes and formatting the websites. This included making and fixing the “Word of the Day” card and connecting backend and frontend together. After finalizing changes we disscussed how we are going to present each part of the project during Night at the Museum. .",

Considerations made for customers We understand the customer needs an efficiant website which is user friendly, so were going to make our website easy to use and provide instructions as well to help them make the most out of their experience. We’ll also try to make an efficiant website by removing non-essential items which slow the efficiancy of our website, allowing for a better customer expirience . | Accommodations We plan to add text-to-speech to our project to help people with vision problems and for those who are learning English we’ll add a translator, allowing for people to translate any word to their languages for convinience. Through this we can reach a wider variety of people, allowing us to help more people. . | .",
