            "content": "Preface . In this project, we wanted to make a rather useful program that could be used daily: a dictionary. To make this possible, however, we had to find out how to create such an object. To make a dictionary, we scoured the internet for instructive videos which labeled the skeleton of an online dictionary through class lessons, we learned that the easiest way to create such a device would be to use an API. Through RapidAPI, an API website, we quickly discovered a suitable API for our project. We then utilized our resources carefully, planning 2-week sprints in order to complete the project. We also used Scrum boards to plan what to do and when to do it. One of the team’s earliest problems was a communication issue. How were they to reach each other and communicate with them? In this issue, Slack was their saving grace: it helped the team communicate when at home and plan meetings to catch up. . Issues in Making the Project . Another issue that the team encountered was finding good resources to help with the design of the dictionary and troubleshooting it. Not many people had before designed an entire dictionary using API and Visual Studio Code. To help us, our APCSP course helped us by not only introducing us to API in the first place but also teaching us the fine art of troubleshooting and debugging. Our course helped us a lot on this project and helped us understand the ever-complicated world of computer science. . Scrum Master Statement . The team has definitely worked hard to reach the completion of the project and has truly understood the workings of computer science and several other objects that they required to complete the task of creating a dictionary. The team faced several issues and hiccups in the procedure but did not give up, whatever stood in their way. .",
