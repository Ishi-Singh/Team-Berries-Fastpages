Since we’re still in some of the beginning stages of making this project we don’t know if all of these ideas will be implemented in the final product. but we hope to implement as many of them if time permits. | . Scrum Master . DevOps Engineer . Goals: . make sure the aws instance continues running w/out any issues, or fix any problems that come up | help the backend developer with any of her work if she needs it | figure out why we keep having merge conflicts??? | . Backend Developer . Frontend Developer . Wireframes for our website | . This is how we want to make the inital user input screen . This is what the user should see after inputing a word . We also want to add a word of the day page which gives a list of some words . Considerations made for customers We understand the customer needs an efficiant website which is user friendly, so were going to make our website easy to use and provide instructions as well to help them make the most out of their experience. We’ll also try to make an efficiant website by removing non-essential items which slow the efficiancy of our website, allowing for a better customer expirience . | Accommodations We plan to add text-to-speech to our project to help people with vision problems and for those who are learning English we’ll add a translator, allowing for people to translate any word to their languages for convinience. Through this we can reach a wider variety of people, allowing us to help more people. . | .",
