Considerations made for customers We understand the customer needs an efficiant website which is user friendly, so were going to make our website easy to use and provide instructions as well to help them make the most out of their experience. We’ll also try to make an efficiant website by removing non-essential items which slow the efficiancy of our website, allowing for a better customer expirience . | Accommodations We plan to add text-to-speech to our project to help people with vision problems and for those who are learning English we’ll add a translator, allowing for people to translate any word to their languages for convinience.
